	abstract = {The THO complex participates during eukaryotic mRNA biogenesis in coupling transcription to formation and nuclear export of translation-competent messenger ribonucleoprotein particles. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, THO has been defined as a heteropentamer composed of the Tho2p, Hpr1p, Tex1p, Mft1p, and Thp2p subunits and the overall three-dimensional shape of the complex has been established by negative stain electron microscopy. Here, we use small-angle X-ray scattering measured for isolated THO components (Mft1p and Thp2p) as well as THO subcomplexes (Mft1p-Thp2p and Mft1p-Thp2p-Tho2p) to construct structural building blocks that allow positioning of each subunit within the complex. To accomplish this, the individual envelopes determined for Mft1p and Thp2p are first fitted inside those of the Mft1p-Thp2p and Mft1p-Thp2p-Tho2p complexes. Next, the ternary complex structure is placed in the context of the five-component electron microscopy structure. Our model reveals not only the position of each protein in the THO complex relative to each other, but also shows that the pentamer is likely somewhat larger than what was observed by electron microscopy.},

They are point processes whose defining characteristic is that they 'self-excite', meaning that each arrival increases the rate of future arrivals for some period of time. Hawkes processes are well established, particularly within the financial literature, yet many of the treatments are inaccessible to one not acquainted with the topic. This survey provides background, introduces the field and historical developments, and touches upon all major aspects of Hawkes processes.},

The methods are explained using illustrative examples. The article starts with the classical Gillespie algorithm for the stochastic modelling of chemical reactions. Then stochastic algorithms for modelling molecular diffusion are given. Finally, basic stochastic reaction-diffusion methods are presented. The connections between stochastic simulations and deterministic models are explained and basic mathematical tools (e.g. chemical master equation) are presented. The article concludes with an overview of more advanced methods and problems.},
